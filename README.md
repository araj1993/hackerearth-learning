## ✅ Task Requirements

1. Write a Python program that:
    - Takes a sentence as input.
    - Encodes it using the rotation rule.
    - Prints the secret encoded message.

2. The program should work for **any number of words** in a sentence.

**Explanation:**

- 1st word → `"HELLO"` → rotate right by 1 → `"OHELL"`
- 2nd word → `"WORLD"` → rotate right by 2 → `"DLRWO"`
- 3rd word → `"PYTHON"` → rotate right by 3 → `"HONPYT"`
